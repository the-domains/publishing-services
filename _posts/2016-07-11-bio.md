Jay Gamel offers a full compliment of publishing services, including writing, editing, layout and pre-press preparations.

He has worked in the publishing field for more than 50 year, from Commerce Clearing House to the Rolling Stone Magazine, and has been a practicing journalist and editor for the past 30 years in Sonoma County's Wine Country.

Writing Samples will be posted and can easily be found at the Kenwood Press, a paper he founded in 1988 that is still healthy and vibrant under the ownership of Alec and Ann Peters.
